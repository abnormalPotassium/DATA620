Who is she? And who are you? And why are you both there? Case #1472 is mystery information digging interrogation thriller game where there are more things going on than what meets the eye, but are you able to unravel what has happened?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Premise</h2>* There is a knock at the door, and someone enters the room. *<br><br><br>- Mrs. Emma Hollis, I presume? My name is Simon. I’m here to interview you about the recent events you were involved in. <br>- Shall we begin with an easy question?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What you are supposed to do</h2>Imagine you enter a room and there is a mysterious woman sitting in front of you. The lightning in the room is so poor you can hardly see her face. Who is she?<br><br><br>As the player starting up this game for the first time, you truly will not know anything about the situation you\\'ve been thrown into.<br><br>Try and ask her questions (anything that you might find would be useful to ask) in order to see if you can understand what is going on.<br><br>Begin with an easy question and see where you go from there.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This game has no clear end</h2>Unlike other games, this game has no clear definition of end. The premise of the game is that you are interrogating a mysterious woman. You can ask her any question as you wish and she will respond (to the best of her abilities). But how many questions you need to ask, which questions you need to ask and what information you are suppose to find is not clearly defined for you. If you feel like you have done a good job with the interrogation, simply end the game and walk away. However, the question you need to ask yourself is though, did you truly understand what is going on or did you miss something?<br><br><br>We created the game deliberately like this, as we wanted the game to be purely investigatory driven by the player. Any information you find and extract is solely thanks to your own imagination of asking questions and interrogating her. We also wanted this game to be a social cooperative experience. For example, you might play this game for while and then challenge or compare your findings with a friend. Did you both figure out the same information? Maybe you both unraveled two different key information and if you piece them together you both now understand the bigger picture?<br><br>Seeing that there is no clear end to this game, we encourage cooperative and information exchanging among friends, as well as on other discussion forums and platforms.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game mechanics and features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> This is an information digging interrogation game where the player may type and ask the woman any question they wish<br></li><li> If she knows the answer she will respond to the question, otherwise the player will get a dismissive answer<br></li><li> The game automatically collects all asked questions by all the players in order to slowly improve over time<br></li><li> The game has no clear end so the player can decide when to end the game at any time<br></li><li> Achievements<br></li><li> Custom made YouTube safe music soundtrack</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Thank you for play testing this game, your feedback is important!</h2>We want to explore the idea of creating an immersive mystery thriller interrogation game with a fully fleshed out and detailed story plot behind it.<br><br>This is why we have published a working early version of the game in order to get as much feedback as possible!

Interact with all shapes and kinds of terrain. Fly, jump, swing, and bounce through the world in whatever way you can imagine to reach your goals. Rather than a health bar, Kinetic uses a timer that slowly depletes. Getting hit by enemies will take away chunks of your remaining time, but destroy enemies to add to the timer and make it to the end of the level! <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nInspired by games like Megaman X4 and Super Smash Bros. Melee, Kinetic is a fresh experience of movement and close-up combat with its own intricacies and tricks to explore.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n-Rollback netplay multiplayer.

       "    'about_the_game': \"Kinetic: Break All Limits is a high speed 2d platformer with a focus on different types of movement. You play as Kin, a resident of a remote world, who must rescue his home from the existential threat of an alien menace and save his family.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nHe's always had a talent for athletics, but with his new suit technology, it feels like anything is possible. Interact with all shapes and kinds of terrain. Fly, jump, swing, and bounce through the world in whatever way you can imagine to reach your goals. Rather than a health bar, Kinetic uses a timer that slowly depletes. Getting hit by enemies will take away chunks of your remaining time, but destroy enemies to add to the timer and make it to the end of the level! <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nInspired by games like Megaman X4 and Super Smash Bros. Melee, Kinetic is a fresh experience of movement and close-up combat with its own intricacies and tricks to explore.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n-Rollback netplay multiplayer.

These materials will hamper your combat abilities, but can also be traded for various rewards. You can even use them to give birth to minions, who will assist you in battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat system</h2>The combat system is completely unlike typical menu-based RPGs: <br><br>Your various abilities are in the form of tokens--physical objects that are shaken around in a tray from which 3 or more are selected each turn. You can then chose to use these tokens and their associated abilities, or reroll your tray to select new tokens. Various game mechanics adds layers of complexity to this underlying system, making it more engaging then traditional RPGs.<br><br>As a modern rogue-like, the combat as well as progression throughout each play session incorporates many tested-and-true features, such as forecasted enemy-intent, limited RNG usage, and non-linear growth.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sexual content</h2>This game contains a large amount of explicit sexual images intended for an adult audience.<br><br>Besides miscellaneous explicit graphics in UIs and cutscenes, each enemy in this game has 2 unique, hand-drawn images showing its...interaction with the heroine. (In early access many of these are placeholder but will be replaced by polish art as the game finishes)<br><br>As the game develops through Early Access, new features such as NPC interactions will add new ways for the player to admire mature works of art.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dedication</h2>This game is made for the lovely Seaworthy.<br><br>Without her funding and support throughout development, the game would not be possible.',\n",

Due to being developed by a small team and lacking sufficient testing feedback, we are releasing it early to gather player feedback. Please do not compare it to games developed by professional teams over many years. There are still many features to be implemented and numerous bugs waiting to be resolved.<br />\\r\\nEnglish version will come soon.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nGame World:<br />\\r\\nThe game world concept blends Chinese ancient mythology, geographical texts like Shan Hai Jing, and the Buddhist concept of the Three Realms Six Worlds. In this world, there are demons, monsters, spirits, gods, and even creatures from both Eastern and Western mythology. Players can choose any race to begin their cultivation journey. Of course, it's all thanks to a nine-tailed celestial fox's avatar taking residence inside your body. With her presence, you have protection and guidance – if you can't win, at least you can escape!<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nArt Style:<br />\\r\\nThe game's content includes monsters from both East and West, giving it a fusion of artistic styles rather than being purely Eastern or Western. The style might still be immature, and many character images may be rough; we ask for your understanding. The complete version will be more refined. Although I corporated AI assistance into development a year and a half later, the artistic style was already mostly formed.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nGame Mechanics:<br />\\r\\n1.Random Generation: Randomness is a core aspect of this game. Maps, dungeons, characters, equipment attributes, and even some martial arts attributes are all randomly generated.<br />\\r\\n2.Casual Combat: Originally, combat was turn-based RPG in a side-scrolling format. However, due to laziness, characters now fight automatically, and I disliked repeatedly selecting skills, so I made skills appear as cards for easy selection. It's not a card game, though some skills can change the tide of battle. When selecting cards, time in battle flows at 1% bullet time.<br />\\r\\n3.The game focuses on character selection and cultivation. Only those with high talent can go far. Players can recruit characters with good relationships to join them. Different races have different leveling methods. The higher a sect's reputation, the more visitors it attracts, so early on, players should recruit from surrounding towns.<br />\\r\\n4.The island serves as the player's home or sect and can be developed. Inside, players can forge items, practice alchemy, and interact with companions.<br />\\r\\n5.Players can explore and attack other locations, including towns and sects, and may be attacked by other sects.<br />\\r\\n6.Companions. have expenses, so players need to earn money to avoid bankruptcy.<br />\\r\\n7.As buildings increase and levels rise, players can unlock portals to other states and even realms, each with different monsters, rules, and loot.<br />\\r\\n8.Finding other tails and challenging the gods from Shan Hai Jing is the game's main storyline, if it has one.<br />\\r\\n9.Each tail has different but powerful skills, and each tail represents a save file. You can learn other tail's skills by only defeat that tail. Don't forget it, it is all your save data.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nInspiration:<br />\\r\\nHello, everyone! I'm the developer, LouisWu. This game originated from a dream I had two years ago. I dreamt I transformed into a nine-tailed fox being chased by cultivators. While dodging them, I also tried to catch fox pups (ironically, I'm male). I woke up with vivid memories of the dream and recorded everything I could remember. Later, I decided to pause the development of a sailing game and create this one.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAdult Content Disclaimer:<br />\\r\\nThe game may contains some extremely simple dialogues for flirt and procreation. Few demon characters may have female or human body characteristics. Few human outfits look like bikinis may be somewhat sexy, and some nine-tailed fox characters may be sexier. This game has no sexual assault/non-consensual sex, and no drug or alcohol abuse.\",\n",

Maps, dungeons, characters, equipment attributes, and even some martial arts attributes are all randomly generated.<br />\\r\\n2.Casual Combat: Originally, combat was turn-based RPG in a side-scrolling format. However, due to laziness, characters now fight automatically, and I disliked repeatedly selecting skills, so I made skills appear as cards for easy selection. It's not a card game, though some skills can change the tide of battle. When selecting cards, time in battle flows at 1% bullet time.<br />\\r\\n3.The game focuses on character selection and cultivation. Only those with high talent can go far. Players can recruit characters with good relationships to join them. Different races have different leveling methods. The higher a sect's reputation, the more visitors it attracts, so early on, players should recruit from surrounding towns.<br />\\r\\n4.The island serves as the player's home or sect and can be developed. Inside, players can forge items, practice alchemy, and interact with companions.<br />\\r\\n5.Players can explore and attack other locations, including towns and sects, and may be attacked by other sects.<br />\\r\\n6.Companions. have expenses, so players need to earn money to avoid bankruptcy.<br />\\r\\n7.As buildings increase and levels rise, players can unlock portals to other states and even realms, each with different monsters, rules, and loot.<br />\\r\\n8.Finding other tails and challenging the gods from Shan Hai Jing is the game's main storyline, if it has one.<br />\\r\\n9.Each tail has different but powerful skills, and each tail represents a save file. You can learn other tail's skills by only defeat that tail. Don't forget it, it is all your save data.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nInspiration:<br />\\r\\nHello, everyone! I'm the developer, LouisWu. This game originated from a dream I had two years ago. I dreamt I transformed into a nine-tailed fox being chased by cultivators. While dodging them, I also tried to catch fox pups (ironically, I'm male). I woke up with vivid memories of the dream and recorded everything I could remember. Later, I decided to pause the development of a sailing game and create this one.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAdult Content Disclaimer:<br />\\r\\nThe game may contains some extremely simple dialogues for flirt and procreation. Few demon characters may have female or human body characteristics. Few human outfits look like bikinis may be somewhat sexy, and some nine-tailed fox characters may be sexier. This game has no sexual assault/non-consensual sex, and no drug or alcohol abuse.\",\n",

In 2016 he proposed this idea to develop a small 2D Android game (at that time though, the characters were robots, not monsters, with simpler 2D graphics) at university.

The resulting game is Save All Monsters! While Albert programmed and designed this game alone, some ideas are based on Pau\\'s web version of the robots game (such as a character ability that insipired the thief ability, or the usage of different level grid rotations). Thanks to Pau\\'s consent to the usage of those ideas here, the current game was made more engaging.<br><br>Enjoy playing the game!',\n",

The more Japanese words and grammar you learn, the more dialogue will appear in Japanese!<br><br>For example, consider the following sentence: &quot;doko iku?&quot;  (Where are we going?)  <br><br>If you don\\'t know one of the words &quot;doko&quot; (where) or &quot;iku&quot; (go, going), then this sentence will be shown in English.  This is to avoid frustrating you with content you haven\\'t yet learned.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986950/extras/doko_iku_englih.png?t=1691276903\" /><br><br>However, if you know both words, it will be written in Japanese hiragana.<br><br>Pressing a button displays the &quot;roumaji&quot; of the sentence. Roumaji uses the English alphabet to describe Japanese sounds.  A second press displays the English translation.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986950/extras/doku_iku_anim.gif?t=1691276903\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Professional Japanese voice acting (Over 4000 lines of spoken dialogue)<br></li><li>Teaches Japanese starting from zero<br></li><li>Teaches all the most common hiragana<br></li><li>Teaches over 240+ Japanese words commonly used in anime<br></li><li>Teaches word usage and Japanese grammar (over 50 tutorials)<br></li><li>Adaptive Dialogue System gets you reading Japanese fast without being overwhelmed<br></li><li>Real-time battles and humorous dialogue make learning fast and fun<br></li><li>Gradual Reveal Dialogue System let\\'s you conveniently check your reading comprehension<br></li><li>All Hiragana Mode let\\'s advanced adventurers immerse themselves instantly in a deeper Japanese experience<br></li><li>Battle drills can be disabled at any time<br></li><li>Level up controls allow you to adjust the pace of your learning<br></li><li>Disable automatic voice over to practice reading comprehension easily<br></li><li>16-20 hours of gameplay</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tremendous replay value.

The release is a low poly first person platformer in VR. It is inspired from the old platformers from the 8 bit and 16 bit era but brought into the present with VR.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe demo consists of:\\r\\n\\r\\nCut down Main Menu (A few options are greyed out)\\r\\nWorm Hold travel\\r\\nStart Scene\\r\\n\\r\\nand one level which has an extra added area for players to try out some physics that will be in one of the levels in the full game.\\r\\nThe cinematic cutscenes are not in this demo but here is the storyline:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character you play as has an addiction to a 3D Platformer with the same name is this title. He spends hours every night playing until the early hours. He is so addicted he even has merchandise and posters from the game in his room. One night after a long gaming session he goes to bed, he is only asleep for a short time as he gets awakened with an explosion sound. He awakens with a jump to find smoke in his room and what looks like a holographic portal emitting from one of his computer screens. He gets up to investigate and find himself being drawn into the portal and travelling through a wormhole inside his computer... \\r\\n\\r\\nHe appears on the other side after exiting the wormhole and finds himself inside the game he plays, AND that he is now the lead character. He then has to assist the friendly NPC's by ridding their game world from Ogleath and his Rogue army. The player then has to battle through various levels, defeating the enemies in different ways, climbing walls, rocks and mountains, abseiling, driving cars, controlling remote controlled cars, using physics and portals...\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of each level a portal will appear either freely or after you have solved a puzzle or defeated a boss guarding the portal.. each portal gives you access to the next level and a way to progress. You are trapped inside this game until the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim is to defeat the army and the bosses, and eventually face Ogleath and defeat him. Only once Ogleath and his army are defeated can you then travel safely back to your own dimension, your own reality through another wormhole and resume life once more.\",\n",

He gets up to investigate and find himself being drawn into the portal and travelling through a wormhole inside his computer... <br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nHe appears on the other side after exiting the wormhole and finds himself inside the game he plays, AND that he is now the lead character. He then has to assist the friendly NPC's by ridding their game world from Ogleath and his Rogue army. The player then has to battle through various levels, defeating the enemies in different ways, climbing walls, rocks and mountains, abseiling, driving cars, controlling remote controlled cars, using physics and portals...<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nAt the end of each level a portal will appear either freely or after you have solved a puzzle or defeated a boss guarding the portal.. each portal gives you access to the next level and a way to progress. You are trapped inside this game until the end.<br />\\r\\n<br />\\r\\nThe aim is to defeat the army and the bosses, and eventually face Ogleath and defeat him. Only once Ogleath and his army are defeated can you then travel safely back to your own dimension, your own reality through another wormhole and resume life once more.\",\n",

They had developed an entire system based on the creation of these Golems that could live off these sources of energy and do the work that no one wanted to be bothered with.In pursuit of power, they abused the magical energy which ultimately led to their downfall.The game takes place long after the ancient civilization, where the magical energy reclaims the world by giving life back to the Golems. Born from the union of the world's magical energy and the ancient civilization's engineering, you take control of one of these hybrid stone creatures.One of the unique features of Unpetrified is the importance of the protagonists' emotions, which immediately affect the weather, plants and animals around it. This strong connection is the result of the bond between the Golem and the magical energy that flows within it, coming from the world in which it was born. Accompany the Golem on its journey to find the meaning of existence and a place where it belongs.On your journey you get to travel through a whole variety of landscapes, which all contain their own unique flora and fauna. They blend seamlessly from one to another, letting you traverse from one to the next.\n",

      "Dragon Mine is a game about gold miner who is trapped in the gold mine with unknown creatures: some are neutral, some are aggressive, some are annoying. Go through the numerous mazes and try to get to the cave full of gold waiting at the end, but remember - the journey won't be easy. Think fast and move precisely to get to the exit - any delay may result in the escape portal to be covered with mysterious water, blocking your way out.50 levels, 5 bosses and unusual ending are waiting for you. Some levels are straight-forward run-through mazes that will require speed and precision, some will utilize your outside the box thinking, as the obvious way may be the wrong one. There are places that might look unpassable, but there is surely a way out. Everything should be done fast, as the mazes are being flooded by a mystic water that will kill the player if he touches it, and there is a chance you will find the exit covered with the water if you are too slow in collecting the coins: in some cases even one lost second can decide if you pass the level or not.There are monsters in the mazes that are not happy to see you down there. Some of them will ignore you some will try to make your life harder in a passive way, and some are really aggressive. You can't kill anyone, but everyone can kill you. There are monsters that are always faster than player: you can't outrun them, however they aren't too clever, so you have a chance to outsmart them.This game will require all your concentration, it will make your hands shaking after each level completion, but nice ambient music will help you keep your rage away after you fail again and again. To pass to the new level you need to collect only 80% of all the coins in each maze (except for the bosses), however some achievements will stay unreachable for you till you collect everything (don't worry - the levels are built the way that there is guaranteed enough of time to pass them ideally).In case you have controlling skills and reaction of a super hero, the game is possible to complete in 90-100 minutes, but it is much more likely that it will take you up to 50 (or maybe even more) hours of intense gameplay to complete the game ideally and collect all the achievements.\n",

      "A mysterious woman is sitting in front of you. Who is she? And who are you? And why are you both there? Case #1472 is mystery information digging interrogation thriller game where there are more things going on than what meets the eye, but are you able to unravel what has happened?Premise* There is a knock at the door, and someone enters the room. *- Mrs. Emma Hollis, I presume? My name is Simon. I’m here to interview you about the recent events you were involved in. - Shall we begin with an easy question?What you are supposed to doImagine you enter a room and there is a mysterious woman sitting in front of you. The lightning in the room is so poor you can hardly see her face. Who is she?As the player starting up this game for the first time, you truly will not know anything about the situation you've been thrown into.Try and ask her questions (anything that you might find would be useful to ask) in order to see if you can understand what is going on.Begin with an easy question and see where you go from there.This game has no clear endUnlike other games, this game has no clear definition of end. The premise of the game is that you are interrogating a mysterious woman. You can ask her any question as you wish and she will respond (to the best of her abilities). But how many questions you need to ask, which questions you need to ask and what information you are suppose to find is not clearly defined for you. If you feel like you have done a good job with the interrogation, simply end the game and walk away. However, the question you need to ask yourself is though, did you truly understand what is going on or did you miss something?We created the game deliberately like this, as we wanted the game to be purely investigatory driven by the player. Any information you find and extract is solely thanks to your own imagination of asking questions and interrogating her. We also wanted this game to be a social cooperative experience. For example, you might play this game for while and then challenge or compare your findings with a friend. Did you both figure out the same information? Maybe you both unraveled two different key information and if you piece them together you both now understand the bigger picture?Seeing that there is no clear end to this game, we encourage cooperative and information exchanging among friends, as well as on other discussion forums and platforms.Game mechanics and features This is an information digging interrogation game where the player may type and ask the woman any question they wish If she knows the answer she will respond to the question, otherwise the player will get a dismissive answer The game automatically collects all asked questions by all the players in order to slowly improve over time The game has no clear end so the player can decide when to end the game at any time Achievements Custom made YouTube safe music soundtrackThank you for play testing this game, your feedback is important!We want to explore the idea of creating an immersive mystery thriller interrogation game with a fully fleshed out and detailed story plot behind it.This is why we have published a working early version of the game in order to get as much feedback as possible! So if you have time, please give us feedback (good or bad) using the feedback button or on Steam - we would really appreciate it!However, even though this is an early version and we have a long list of things we want to improve and add (everything from thriller elements, better UI to professional voice acting, etc), there are more things going on than what meets the eye here...Credits Emma is voiced by Grimmi Grevillea Grimoire The story was fabricated by Elizabeth Price All the bugs are caused by Broken at Release\n",

Make it even farther, and you'll find yourself fighting enemies with altered attacks and behaviors than what they had previously.Acquire PowerupsWhile plowing through enemies, each one will have a chance to drop a powerup, a powerful item with extensive abilities that you can use. Fire a laser at enemies in your path, clear foes with a barrage of bees, or make your bullets hurt a little more with your favorite can of chunky soup. Some will grant temporary effects, some will fire projectiles, and some will grant permanent buffs for you or your allies. You can hold 2 at a time, so mix and match to what fits your playstyle.The Powerup CatalogThe catalog has information on every powerup you have, with specific stats and descriptions so that you know in a moment's notice what each and every powerup does in your situation. While you only start with a few powerups available, you can purchase them from the powerup catalog and have them available for your future rounds. By completing waves, you earn arena tickets, which are spent on powerups to expand your arsenal. The better you play, the more you earn.Customize Your RunsThe powerup catalog has the ability to enable or disable certain powerups, so you can customize your runs as much as you'd like. Want to run only your favorites? Go for it. Want to see how far you can get with a select few? Completely fine. Want to run the original five? The cops won't stop you. Feel free to use any modifiers as well, to give some extra spice or challenge to your runs. Play how you want, and don't be afraid to try something new.\n",

      "«This is a game with real freedom of choice. But every decision has its price!»«Nirmita is a place where imaginary foes become real friends»«Survival RPG you can play with one hand»Our Narrator says:«The game takes place in the world of Nirmita. The Hero, who conveniently lost his memory after being transported from another dimension, learns the time in Nirmita has stopped. A wizard did it! An evil one, naturally. And now it's up to the Hero to find the villain! Local population will aid the Hero in this task as he evolves from a clueless caveman to a powerful warrior who... still lives in a cave. But an upgraded one! With a door and everything. And as the Hero traverses this thorny path he will have to decide who to trust. For the evil wizard could have allies...»Game Features 7 stats that level up as you use them. Crush your enemies with strength or dexterity, charm them and turn them into allies with your charisma or use your intelligence to brew potions that will turn the tide of battle. Or even do all of that at once. 25 skills taught by the local NPCs. You can specialise or be a jack of all trades. Survival mechanics which require you to keep track of health, hunger and energy. Unlike many other survival games, this one is essentially turn-based, allowing you to carefully plan your next move or even the whole day! As a result, your survival depends not on luck or speed but rather your ability to plan ahead. A turn-based combat system that requires you to adapt instead of using just one weapon to beat every enemy. 6 bright and unique locations — caves and meadows, swamps and forests, mountains and lakes. 5 beautiful female characters the player can interact with and motivate them to change into more and more charming outfits. 70 (sic!) unique enemy types the Hero will have to face during his struggle for survival. Defeated enemies can be tamed, allowing the player to use them in battles as well as enjoy some passive bonuses. Catch them all! Dozens of weapons, potions, meals, pieces of furniture and other equipment to craft! Home improvements that not only give the player more time to act each day but also visually enhance the cave!\n",

      "Gameplay OverviewYou play as Seaworthy--Oceanus's last defender against a mysterious alien invasion. You will move through semi-randomly generated maps and encounter monsters along the way which you must fight via the game's combat system.After each battle you may use the experience points to upgrade yourself, improving and significantly changing your fighting capabilities in modern rogue-like fashion. Other events such as loot and merchant can also improve your power in unique ways.Due to the corruptive origin of your monstrous enemies, they may attack you in sexual as well as physical ways, and may inject you with their various genetic materials. These materials will hamper your combat abilities, but can also be traded for various rewards. You can even use them to give birth to minions, who will assist you in battle.Combat systemThe combat system is completely unlike typical menu-based RPGs: Your various abilities are in the form of tokens--physical objects that are shaken around in a tray from which 3 or more are selected each turn.

      "The game world concept blends Chinese ancient mythology, geographical texts like Shan Hai Jing, and the Buddhist concept of the Three Realms Six Worlds. In this world, there are demons, monsters, spirits, gods, and even creatures from both Eastern and Western mythology. Players can choose any race to begin their cultivation journey. Of course, it's all thanks to a nine-tailed celestial fox's avatar taking residence inside your body.

      "2.Casual Combat: Originally, combat was turn-based RPG in a side-scrolling format. However, due to laziness, characters now fight automatically, and I disliked repeatedly selecting skills, so I made skills appear as cards for easy selection. It's not a card game, though some skills can change the tide of battle. When selecting cards, time in battle flows at 1% bullet time.\r\n",
      "3.The game focuses on character selection and cultivation. Only those with high talent can go far. Players can recruit characters with good relationships to join them. Different races have different leveling methods. The higher a sect's reputation, the more visitors it attracts, so early on, players should recruit from surrounding towns.\r\n",
      "4.The island serves as the player's home or sect and can be developed. Inside, players can forge items, practice alchemy, and interact with companions.\r\n",
      "5.Players can explore and attack other locations, including towns and sects, and may be attacked by other sects.\r\n",
      "6.Companions. have expenses, so players need to earn money to avoid bankruptcy.\r\n",
      "7.As buildings increase and levels rise, players can unlock portals to other states and even realms, each with different monsters, rules, and loot.\r\n",
      "8.Finding other tails and challenging the gods from Shan Hai Jing is the game's main storyline, if it has one.\r\n",

      "Inspiration:\r\n",
      "Hello, everyone! I'm the developer, LouisWu. This game originated from a dream I had two years ago. I dreamt I transformed into a nine-tailed fox being chased by cultivators. While dodging them, I also tried to catch fox pups (ironically, I'm male). I woke up with vivid memories of the dream and recorded everything I could remember. Later, I decided to pause the development of a sailing game and create this one.\n",

You may also encounter different monsters and random events.The round combat system adopted in the game takes breaking shield as the core. The monster has a layer of armor. The number of armor layers of the enemy can be broken by attack or magic.When the enemy's armor layer becomes 0, it is in the shield breaking state. In the shield breaking state, you will hit more damage. multiple monsters [/]There are abundant monsters and seven different styles of boss wars on the map. Each boss has a unique fighting mechanism and playing method. Of course, you can also pass level rolling or props to win the battle.

You need to observe the enemy's shot and singing time, and reasonably allocate physical strength and magic value.Physical strength: used for power accumulation attack or magic. The attack command after power accumulation will hit multiple segments of damage. The magic command after power accumulation will hit higher damage. Magic value: when dealing with the boss, if the enemy is magic armor, you need to beat magic damage rhythmically to break the shield, but you should master yourselfWhen your magic value is empty, you can fill your magic value back and forth through defense.Defense mechanism: when facing the enemy's powerful moves, you can defend. Defense will provide you with 50% damage reduction by default.Anger skill: attack or magic damage will accumulate anger value.

      "The gameSave All Monsters! is a puzzle game where you have to place all the monsters in safe squares before the time ends! Analyze the chess-like attack patterns of weapons to avoid danger. Use resistant monsters to protect normal monsters from ranged attacks! Keep social distancing with bomb monsters! Discover and save all the monsters! This game is a mixture of elements from traditional games like chess or minesweeper, with the fast-paced strategical thinking imposed by the time limit, along with managing an inventory of characters with different abilitiesWhen playing a level, analyze the weapons (and their influence area), the free squares, and the monsters in your inventory. To beat a level, all monsters need to be safely placed in the level before the time ends. If any monster is defeated or is not placed when time ends, you lose. While normal monsters can't stand a single hit, spiky monsters can resist as many attacks as spikes they have. Use them to protect other monsters from attacks that cover multiple squares. As you advance in the game you will unlock additional types of monsters, such as the bomb monster, whose blast can neutralize anything nearby, including monsters! A safer alternative to disable nearby weapons is the inhibitor monster. Also be careful with thief monsters, since they remove the special abilities of monsters nearby!The game includes 3 worlds with 8 levels each, with increasing difficulty and size. Each level has multiple grid rotations to make it more replayable and emplace recurring players to keep thinking logically instead of memorizing key spots. You will start avoiding boxing gloves, to later face the threat of flamethrowers, beam turrets and electric weapons!Development storyThe gameplay concept of Save All Monsters! (placing characters in a grid with weapons that can attack them before the time ends, with the presence of multiple character types like resistant ones) dates back to 2014, and was conceived by the author of this game, Albert Espín. He started implementing a game based on this concept but eventually moved to another project. In 2016 he proposed this idea to develop a small 2D Android game (at that time though, the characters were robots, not monsters, with simpler 2D graphics) at university. Albert and other students made that robots game, which was praised by early testers due to its engaging gameplay, and obtained the maximum score of the course. Nevertheless, it was never released for Android, although in 2017 Pau Sanchez made a web version of it. In 2021, Albert decided to create a new game based on the original game mechanics conceived in 2014, but this time using 3D graphics and Unreal Engine, instead of Android-specific tools, and monsters instead of robots. The resulting game is Save All Monsters! While Albert programmed and designed this game alone, some ideas are based on Pau's web version of the robots game (such as a character ability that insipired the thief ability, or the usage of different level grid rotations). Thanks to Pau's consent to the usage of those ideas here, the current game was made more engaging.Enjoy playing the game!\n",

      "This Bundle Contains:Tier III Premium German 43 M. Toldi III light tankGarage slot100% trained crew (commander with Sixth Sense)3 days of WoT Premium account Bundle Description: Finding this tank on the battlefield might be a hard task for your opponents. Meet the 43 M. Toldi III, a Tier III Premium German light tank that comes with the DLC “Stealthy Threat”! Concealment and Speed: This vehicle is among the top-5 stealthiest Tier III light tanks, with excellent stationary and moving camo values. This will allow you to remain invisible to the enemy vehicles while revealing their positions to your allies, as well as to perform sudden surprise attacks on the unsuspecting opponents. This is where vehicle’s good maneuverability comes in handy: even though the top speed is quite average for a light tank of its tier, you are still able to perform dynamic plays for flank attacks or circling more cumbersome enemy tanks.Firepower: The 43 M. Toldi III gun penetration values of 64/80/20mm are decent for a light tank, and its ammo rack holds 150 shells, meaning that even in prolonged battles you don’t have to worry about running out of ammunition. However, the tank does not boast a high DPM and therefore is bound to play a support role in the battle, using its great camo rating for passive spotting and helping allies to finish off the opponents.Protection: Keep in mind that the 43 M. Toldi III is a light tank, and just like most light tanks it has a rather mediocre armor and an average HP pool of 410 HP, so try to stay stealthy and avoid enemy shots.  This package also includes 3 days of WoT Premium account, that will help you to progress faster in the game by providing a variety of extra bonuses, such as more Credits and XP earned in battles, applicable modifier to XP, Premium missions, one more slot for excluded maps and more. DLC can be added to your World of Tanks account only once.You will be able to use this DLC only if you play from the game account created on Steam.\n",

Go through the numerous mazes and try to get to the cave full of gold waiting at the end, but remember - the journey won't be easy. Think fast and move precisely to get to the exit - any delay may result in the escape portal to be covered with mysterious water, blocking your way out.50 levels, 5 bosses and unusual ending are waiting for you. Some levels are straight-forward run-through mazes that will require speed and precision, some will utilize your outside the box thinking, as the obvious way may be the wrong one. There are places that might look unpassable, but there is surely a way out. Everything should be done fast, as the mazes are being flooded by a mystic water that will kill the player if he touches it, and there is a chance you will find the exit covered with the water if you are too slow in collecting the coins: in some cases even one lost second can decide if you pass the level or not.There are monsters in the mazes that are not happy to see you down there. Some of them will ignore you some will try to make your life harder in a passive way, and some are really aggressive. You can't kill anyone, but everyone can kill you. There are monsters that are always faster than player: you can't outrun them, however they aren't too clever, so you have a chance to outsmart them.This game will require all your concentration, it will make your hands shaking after each level completion, but nice ambient music will help you keep your rage away after you fail again and again. To pass to the new level you need to collect only 80% of all the coins in each maze (except for the bosses), however some achievements will stay unreachable for you till you collect everything (don't worry - the levels are built the way that there is guaranteed enough of time to pass them ideally).In case you have controlling skills and reaction of a super hero, the game is possible to complete in 90-100 minutes, but it is much more likely that it will take you up to 50 (or maybe even more) hours of intense gameplay to complete the game ideally and collect all the achievements.\",\n",

However, the question you need to ask yourself is though, did you truly understand what is going on or did you miss something?We created the game deliberately like this, as we wanted the game to be purely investigatory driven by the player. Any information you find and extract is solely thanks to your own imagination of asking questions and interrogating her. We also wanted this game to be a social cooperative experience. For example, you might play this game for while and then challenge or compare your findings with a friend. Did you both figure out the same information? Maybe you both unraveled two different key information and if you piece them together you both now understand the bigger picture?Seeing that there is no clear end to this game, we encourage cooperative and information exchanging among friends, as well as on other discussion forums and platforms.Game mechanics and features This is an information digging interrogation game where the player may type and ask the woman any question they wish If she knows the answer she will respond to the question, otherwise the player will get a dismissive answer The game automatically collects all asked questions by all the players in order to slowly improve over time The game has no clear end so the player can decide when to end the game at any time Achievements Custom made YouTube safe music soundtrackThank you for play testing this game, your feedback is important!We want to explore the idea of creating an immersive mystery thriller interrogation game with a fully fleshed out and detailed story plot behind it.This is why we have published a working early version of the game in order to get as much feedback as possible!

       " \"Gameplay OverviewYou play as Seaworthy--Oceanus's last defender against a mysterious alien invasion. You will move through semi-randomly generated maps and encounter monsters along the way which you must fight via the game's combat system.After each battle you may use the experience points to upgrade yourself, improving and significantly changing your fighting capabilities in modern rogue-like fashion. Other events such as loot and merchant can also improve your power in unique ways.Due to the corruptive origin of your monstrous enemies, they may attack you in sexual as well as physical ways, and may inject you with their various genetic materials. These materials will hamper your combat abilities, but can also be traded for various rewards. You can even use them to give birth to minions, who will assist you in battle.Combat systemThe combat system is completely unlike typical menu-based RPGs: Your various abilities are in the form of tokens--physical objects that are shaken around in a tray from which 3 or more are selected each turn. You can then chose to use these tokens and their associated abilities, or reroll your tray to select new tokens. Various game mechanics adds layers of complexity to this underlying system, making it more engaging then traditional RPGs.As a modern rogue-like, the combat as well as progression throughout each play session incorporates many tested-and-true features, such as forecasted enemy-intent, limited RNG usage, and non-linear growth.Sexual contentThis game contains a large amount of explicit sexual images intended for an adult audience.Besides miscellaneous explicit graphics in UIs and cutscenes, each enemy in this game has 2 unique, hand-drawn images showing its...interaction with the heroine. (In early access many of these are placeholder but will be replaced by polish art as the game finishes)As the game develops through Early Access, new features such as NPC interactions will add new ways for the player to admire mature works of art.DedicationThis game is made for the lovely Seaworthy.Without her funding and support throughout development, the game would not be possible.\",\n",

       " \"Important Note: This game is still in the testing phase, currently developed about 50%. Due to being developed by a small team and lacking sufficient testing feedback, we are releasing it early to gather player feedback. Please do not compare it to games developed by professional teams over many years. There are still many features to be implemented and numerous bugs waiting to be resolved.\\r\\nEnglish version will come soon.\\n\\r\\nGame World:\\r\\nThe game world concept blends Chinese ancient mythology, geographical texts like Shan Hai Jing, and the Buddhist concept of the Three Realms Six Worlds. In this world, there are demons, monsters, spirits, gods, and even creatures from both Eastern and Western mythology. Players can choose any race to begin their cultivation journey. Of course, it's all thanks to a nine-tailed celestial fox's avatar taking residence inside your body. With her presence, you have protection and guidance – if you can't win, at least you can escape!\\n\\r\\nArt Style:\\r\\nThe game's content includes monsters from both East and West, giving it a fusion of artistic styles rather than being purely Eastern or Western. The style might still be immature, and many character images may be rough; we ask for your understanding. The complete version will be more refined. Although I corporated AI assistance into development a year and a half later, the artistic style was already mostly formed.\\n\\n\\r\\nGame Mechanics:\\r\\n1.Random Generation: Randomness is a core aspect of this game. Maps, dungeons, characters, equipment attributes, and even some martial arts attributes are all randomly generated.\\r\\n2.Casual Combat: Originally, combat was turn-based RPG in a side-scrolling format. However, due to laziness, characters now fight automatically, and I disliked repeatedly selecting skills, so I made skills appear as cards for easy selection. It's not a card game, though some skills can change the tide of battle. When selecting cards, time in battle flows at 1% bullet time.\\r\\n3.The game focuses on character selection and cultivation. Only those with high talent can go far. Players can recruit characters with good relationships to join them. Different races have different leveling methods. The higher a sect's reputation, the more visitors it attracts, so early on, players should recruit from surrounding towns.\\r\\n4.The island serves as the player's home or sect and can be developed. Inside, players can forge items, practice alchemy, and interact with companions.\\r\\n5.Players can explore and attack other locations, including towns and sects, and may be attacked by other sects.\\r\\n6.Companions. have expenses, so players need to earn money to avoid bankruptcy.\\r\\n7.As buildings increase and levels rise, players can unlock portals to other states and even realms, each with different monsters, rules, and loot.\\r\\n8.Finding other tails and challenging the gods from Shan Hai Jing is the game's main storyline, if it has one.\\r\\n9.Each tail has different but powerful skills, and each tail represents a save file. You can learn other tail's skills by only defeat that tail. Don't forget it, it is all your save data.\\n\\r\\nInspiration:\\r\\nHello, everyone! I'm the developer, LouisWu. This game originated from a dream I had two years ago. I dreamt I transformed into a nine-tailed fox being chased by cultivators. While dodging them, I also tried to catch fox pups (ironically, I'm male). I woke up with vivid memories of the dream and recorded everything I could remember. Later, I decided to pause the development of a sailing game and create this one.\\n\\r\\nAdult Content Disclaimer:\\r\\nThe game may contains some extremely simple dialogues for flirt and procreation. Few demon characters may have female or human body characteristics. Few human outfits look like bikinis may be somewhat sexy, and some nine-tailed fox characters may be sexier. This game has no sexual assault/non-consensual sex, and no drug or alcohol abuse.\",\n",

Analyze the chess-like attack patterns of weapons to avoid danger. Use resistant monsters to protect normal monsters from ranged attacks! Keep social distancing with bomb monsters! Discover and save all the monsters! This game is a mixture of elements from traditional games like chess or minesweeper, with the fast-paced strategical thinking imposed by the time limit, along with managing an inventory of characters with different abilitiesWhen playing a level, analyze the weapons (and their influence area), the free squares, and the monsters in your inventory. To beat a level, all monsters need to be safely placed in the level before the time ends. If any monster is defeated or is not placed when time ends, you lose. While normal monsters can't stand a single hit, spiky monsters can resist as many attacks as spikes they have. Use them to protect other monsters from attacks that cover multiple squares. As you advance in the game you will unlock additional types of monsters, such as the bomb monster, whose blast can neutralize anything nearby, including monsters! A safer alternative to disable nearby weapons is the inhibitor monster. Also be careful with thief monsters, since they remove the special abilities of monsters nearby!The game includes 3 worlds with 8 levels each, with increasing difficulty and size. Each level has multiple grid rotations to make it more replayable and emplace recurring players to keep thinking logically instead of memorizing key spots. You will start avoiding boxing gloves, to later face the threat of flamethrowers, beam turrets and electric weapons!Development storyThe gameplay concept of Save All Monsters! (placing characters in a grid with weapons that can attack them before the time ends, with the presence of multiple character types like resistant ones) dates back to 2014, and was conceived by the author of this game, Albert Espín. He started implementing a game based on this concept but eventually moved to another project. In 2016 he proposed this idea to develop a small 2D Android game (at that time though, the characters were robots, not monsters, with simpler 2D graphics) at university. Albert and other students made that robots game, which was praised by early testers due to its engaging gameplay, and obtained the maximum score of the course. Nevertheless, it was never released for Android, although in 2017 Pau Sanchez made a web version of it. In 2021, Albert decided to create a new game based on the original game mechanics conceived in 2014, but this time using 3D graphics and Unreal Engine, instead of Android-specific tools, and monsters instead of robots. The resulting game is Save All Monsters! While Albert programmed and designed this game alone, some ideas are based on Pau's web version of the robots game (such as a character ability that insipired the thief ability, or the usage of different level grid rotations). Thanks to Pau's consent to the usage of those ideas here, the current game was made more engaging.Enjoy playing the game!\",\n",

       " 'This Bundle Contains:Tier III Premium German 43 M. Toldi III light tankGarage slot100% trained crew (commander with Sixth Sense)3 days of WoT Premium account Bundle Description: Finding this tank on the battlefield might be a hard task for your opponents. Meet the 43 M. Toldi III, a Tier III Premium German light tank that comes with the DLC “Stealthy Threat”! Concealment and Speed: This vehicle is among the top-5 stealthiest Tier III light tanks, with excellent stationary and moving camo values. This will allow you to remain invisible to the enemy vehicles while revealing their positions to your allies, as well as to perform sudden surprise attacks on the unsuspecting opponents. This is where vehicle’s good maneuverability comes in handy: even though the top speed is quite average for a light tank of its tier, you are still able to perform dynamic plays for flank attacks or circling more cumbersome enemy tanks.Firepower: The 43 M. Toldi III gun penetration values of 64/80/20mm are decent for a light tank, and its ammo rack holds 150 shells, meaning that even in prolonged battles you don’t have to worry about running out of ammunition. However, the tank does not boast a high DPM and therefore is bound to play a support role in the battle, using its great camo rating for passive spotting and helping allies to finish off the opponents.Protection: Keep in mind that the 43 M. Toldi III is a light tank, and just like most light tanks it has a rather mediocre armor and an average HP pool of 410 HP, so try to stay stealthy and avoid enemy shots.  This package also includes 3 days of WoT Premium account, that will help you to progress faster in the game by providing a variety of extra bonuses, such as more Credits and XP earned in battles, applicable modifier to XP, Premium missions, one more slot for excluded maps and more.

       " 'You are not a soldier. Not a fighter. Just an ordinary maintenance guy caught in the midst of strange events. Yet you have to fight. And you are forced to run. But above all: you must help frozen crew members survive on a spaceship in the middle of nowhere. You are the only one who can save others from death or eternal cryo-sleep. You are made a hero against your will. You become a leader. A slayer.Only really careful and fast will surviveA massive starship navigates through outer space, far from all planets, other vessels, or celestial bodies. On its deck, in cryogenic sleep, future colonizers, workers, soldiers, and... something else waits.Key Features:Explore the shipwreck, find supplies and help other survivorsSolve puzzles, avoid trapsEliminate strange alien creatures in different waysUnfroze a few unlucky souls that may help you solve the mysteryGame features:Exploration and resourcesThe big and beautiful spaceship became a dangerous wreck. It now looks more like a tomb than a vessel full of future colonists. You have to carefully investigate different parts of “Ascendancy”, looking for clues and resources. The most important is oxygen, of course - without O2 you will be dead in a few minutes. Batteries are also more than useful because you need them to power your flashlight, which starts flickering when cells are almost empty. And then it will be completely dark…Engaging storyObviously, your survival is the most important quest you are undertaking. But to live through, you have to solve the mystery: What took place on the space vessel that should transfer the colonists to the distant world? What happened to the crew? Who are these strange creatures that roam the shipwreck? And where are you - in which part of space?Different strategies of survivalThe shipwreck roams with strange and nasty creatures. There are slow ones, stupid ones, fast ones, smart ones, and armed ones (to name a few). You have to eliminate some of them - you may shoot, use mines, or makeshift traps. But most of the time you must avoid those critters or outrun them, employing wits and stealth and counting on luck. Just keep in mind the amount of oxygen you have - the lack of it may kill you…But the best one is to RUN!Other poor soulsFortunately, there are other poor souls on this wreck floating in space. And you - just a normal maintenance guy - you may use them. Some of them you can wake up and they will help you in the best possible way, depending on abilities they have. Others will go on sleeping, waiting for better days. Remember that you need oxygen for those who join you - and three people use more O2 than one… So you have to evaluate if the help is more valuable than the used oxygen?Remember: on a spaceship your enemies can always hear you scream…',\n",

       " 'Learning should be an adventureDialogue changes from English to Japanese as you learn and progress in this comedic RPG backed by professional Japanese voice acting.  Learn Japanese RPG: Hiragana Forbidden Speech is aimed at anime fans with little to no Japanese ability, but any beginner may enjoy and benefit, even those who have learned hiragana before. We\\'ve made the game we wanted to play when we were first learning Japanese.What will I learn?How to read, write, and pronounce hiraganaHiragana is a set of characters used to write Japanese words. Over 240 common Japanese words used in animeEnough grammar to understand basic Japanese sentences\\tHow will I learn?We believe context, immersion, and fun are key to effective learning. This game isn\\'t just an RPG with Japanese flashcard-type battles. It is much more.First, you will learn hiragana by using them in battles.  A hiragana appears and you type in the related roumaji (english character) to attack foes. Each hiragana can be leveled up. The higher its level, the less often it will appear in battle.Second, after learning a new hiragana, you will learn words spelled with that hiragana.  Each word will expand your vocabulary and strengthen your grasp on the hiragana. They will also appear in battles and level up like hiragana. Third, the game\\'s Adaptive Dialogue System will introduce the words you learn into dialogue. Most dialogue is voiced by professional Japanese voice actors. You will hear and see how words fit together to form sentences and experience the use of words in various situations.  Fourth, there are 50+ brief in-game tutorials that will teach you word usage, basic grammar, and a number of Japanese language concepts. However, our emphasis is on learning by doing.What is the Adaptive Dialogue System and how will it help me?The Adaptive Dialogue System helps you learn by doing. It determines whether to show dialogue in Japanese or English based on your current knowledge.  The more Japanese words and grammar you learn, the more dialogue will appear in Japanese!For example, consider the following sentence: \"doko iku?\"  (Where are we going?)  If you don\\'t know one of the words \"doko\" (where) or \"iku\" (go, going), then this sentence will be shown in English.  This is to avoid frustrating you with content you haven\\'t yet learned.However, if you know both words, it will be written in Japanese hiragana.Pressing a button displays the \"roumaji\" of the sentence. Roumaji uses the English alphabet to describe Japanese sounds.  A second press displays the English translation.FeaturesProfessional Japanese voice acting (Over 4000 lines of spoken dialogue)Teaches Japanese starting from zeroTeaches all the most common hiraganaTeaches over 240+ Japanese words commonly used in animeTeaches word usage and Japanese grammar (over 50 tutorials)Adaptive Dialogue System gets you reading Japanese fast without being overwhelmedReal-time battles and humorous dialogue make learning fast and funGradual Reveal Dialogue System let\\'s you conveniently check your reading comprehensionAll Hiragana Mode let\\'s advanced adventurers immerse themselves instantly in a deeper Japanese experienceBattle drills can be disabled at any timeLevel up controls allow you to adjust the pace of your learningDisable automatic voice over to practice reading comprehension easily16-20 hours of gameplayTremendous replay value.

       " '先声明本游戏战斗有一定难度，并不适合喜欢玩挂机刷刷刷的朋友。由于并没有太多的测试人员，主要是我自己在测试，即便我玩了很多遍，但难免会有遗漏和不合理的地方。如果有出现BUG或者大家觉得有某些地方难度不合理，希望大家能积极反馈，评论区留言或者进群@都行！感谢各位赏脸游玩！游戏着有不同于其他回合制游戏的战斗机制，每个角色有着独特且能产生质变的天赋加点，你可以把角色按你想的方向上培养。但是注意你的天赋需要与你主要使用的技能搭配，才能发挥最大效果。本游戏需要注意的点：1.很多技能释放需要tp点，我们可以通过加攻速或者加tp回复来提高tp获取效率。2.技能每次使用会获得熟练度，熟练度可以提升技能等级和伤害，技能熟练度达到要求会解锁更高级技能，所以我们要尽可能多的使用技能，把一个技能练到极致会比每个技能练一会要强得多！3.游戏的里控制技能对任何敌人都有效，但部分怪物被控制后会狂暴，狂暴状态下将免疫控制且伤害可能会略微提高。4.按Q可以快捷保存。5.设置里面有设置战斗加速，修改窗口样式等功能。6.更换装备时镶嵌物品会自动转移到新装备上，不需要自己取下来重新镶嵌。关于战斗：与其他回合制战斗不同，游戏中有攻速属性。攻速直接影响角色普通攻击造成伤害的次数，而普通攻击每次造成伤害恢复5点TP，物理系技能是没有冷却时间的只受TP点数的限制，所以攻速也间接的影响了技能的释放频率。对于敏捷路线的角色，想要提升输出，提升敏捷和攻速是最佳方式。（前提是你的攻击不能太低）对于力量和智力路线的角色，攻速带来的提升并不明显，所以TP恢复至关重要。很多时候直接增加伤害不如增加TP恢复来的实在！关于美术：刚开始是有想请画师和美工的打算，可是了解了下价格我放弃了……整个游戏包括角色立绘、行走图、怪物图片、场景图块、技能特效、UI设计然后一堆图标感觉没个十来万下不来，这让我实在承受不住。后来想找人已合作的方式给分成，但似乎也不现实，毕竟想找人来免费玩你的游戏都挺困难的……所以，只能咬咬牙自己瞎折腾了。游戏的UI素材大部分是RPG make和dlc自带的，也使用了部分其他资源，费劲力气也只能整成现在这样了！关于剧情：作为一个rpg游戏剧情至关重要，但是很遗憾……我个人觉得游戏的剧情框架还是不错的，但是受限于自己的文笔和图片素材不足，很多剧情其实都是根据现有图片素材临时编的。其实游戏中有很多东西没有讲，比如：1.关于水斗的来历，其实佐克和水斗的父母其实曾经也是猎魔者，后来水斗父母意外死亡，于是佐克退隐照顾主角。2.夜瞳的父亲其实是十几年前的被星玄打败的将军，整个军队全部战死无一生还。由于莫名其妙的被人团灭，他从受人尊敬的将军变成笑柄，夜瞳和母亲也饱受其他人的嘲笑，夜瞳的母亲也因此郁郁而终，所以长大后夜瞳来到帕拉斯是想弄清楚当年的事，为父亲正名。3.乌诺斯为啥要打帕拉斯？其实是有人拱火，这个人和故事的幕后黑手麦迪文一样其实都来自的另一个大陆。他们就是想两边拱火，让两国打起来，他们就可以乘机进行实验，制造战斗用的魔物，说白了就是想把这片大陆当成战争实验室。4.其实后续还有剧情，大致内容是：两国还是打起来了，之后再与夜瞳再见面，却不得不兵戎相见。然后会有新角色出现，阻止了战斗，新角色是另一个大陆的人，他正在调查他们那个大陆的一个邪恶组织，而这场战争就是这个邪恶组织在幕后操纵，目的是乘乱制造出可控制的魔物……其实整个剧情有点参考了一部日本动漫《大剑》，这是一部被禁的神作（个人觉得是神作！），至今我的电脑里还有这部动漫的资源，想看的可以加群@我，哈哈哈……后续：虽然这个游戏还有后续剧情，但是暂时不打算出续作，因为我觉得自己目前还没有力能把剩下的故事讲好……也许等哪一天时机成熟了，我会回来继续填这个坑，也许……之后还是会接着做新的游戏，目前有一些思路，大致是一个策略经营+战棋的游戏。新游戏的话打算用unity去做，也会花钱去请美工画师，有新进度我也会在群里通知大家，希望大家到时能关注一下。游戏qq群：634019932作者b站主页：https://space.bilibili.com/320142719头条和西瓜视频：https://www.ixigua.com/home/5495360978?list_entrance=anyVideo',\n",

       " 'An agency called the FED has identified an online group of potential threats. All they need is evidence to have them locked away. You are a new agent going undercover in that online group with the task of getting that evidence, by whatever means necessary.GameplayYou start each workday of The FED at 5pm, in your office, where your boss will fill you in on any important information. You can interact with the members of the group using your PC, which has various desktop icons to click. The main one is the chat client \"Postapp\" the group uses, which allows you to communicate directly with the members, as well as see what they\\'ve been up to during the day. Along with this chat client there is also \"BNM\" news, which will tell you about recent world events, or a streaming platform \"Comfy\" for when you want to pass the time, just to name a few.The goal of the game is to try and get as many members arrested for as long a sentence as possible. At the end of the game you will be given a full breakdown of how well you performed.MechanicsUsing the chat client \"Postapp\" you can talk to the members of the group about all sorts of things. Messages are sent by clicking the member\\'s username in Postapp and clicking \"Message\", then choosing a message topic. Messages with \"...\" at the end normally lead to further options, and sometimes certain responses will unlock new topics to talk about.Time only passes when chatting or watching streams so you cannot ask everything to everyone in the same day. Members also have different schedules when they are online, so you might have to specifically wait to get the guy you\\'re targeting.Each member has his own interests, life situation, and views on how to act. A soldier might join a military parade. An avid reader might try writing a book. A failing small business owner might give up and go back to school.Each also has his own idea of it the player is a friend or foe, and innocent or suspicious. How you talk with a member will change how he feels, and how he acts. Here are just some of the ways you can interact:Act innocent to convince him he can tell you what he\\'s up to.Buddy up talking about his interests, then convince him to change his job, leave university, or skip his friend\\'s wedding.Use an injustice committed against him to tell him he needs to do something about it.Discuss the news to make him angry at society and watch him go off on his own.Members will also send you messages first from time to time, giving you more opportunities to interact.There are many ways that members can get arrested, big and small, with varying charges that can be levied against them. But don\\'t just go for the easiest charge! Courts don\\'t find every defendant guilty, so the more evidence and charges you can get the more likely you are to get them all taken down. It might be best to tell a member to avoid some actions if it could get him arrested for something minor with little evidence early on.

The winter weather wreaks its havoc week after week, and the people of Torlynn are forced to abandon their homes. Only a few hardy souls remain in the village, one being Burgomaster Gustovan. So far the burgomaster's plans to save his town have failed, and now he has but one chance left to save his people. Gustovan seeks the aid of a band of young adventurers. If they can uncover the force lurking in the ruins of Barrik's Keep and destroy the cause of the vile curse, all will be well again. If they fail, no one will be left alive in Torlynn to mourn them.
